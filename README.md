# Udyam Clone

A full-stack clone of the Udyam Registration portal, built with React (frontend), Node.js/Express (backend), MongoDB, and a Python web scraper for dynamic form schema extraction.

## ðŸš€ Live Demo

**Frontend**: [udyam-clone-wrfg.vercel.app](https://udyam-clone-wrfg.vercel.app)

---

## Project Structure

- **frontend/**: React app (Vite) for the user interface, including dynamic form rendering and validation.
- **backend/**: Node.js/Express API server, handles OTP, PAN validation, and stores registration data in MongoDB.
- **scraper/**: Python script using Selenium and BeautifulSoup to scrape the official Udyam registration form and generate a JSON schema for dynamic form rendering.

## Features

### Frontend

- Modern React UI styled to match the official Udyam portal.
- Dynamic form rendering based on a JSON schema (auto-generated by the scraper).
- Aadhaar and PAN validation flows with OTP.
- Progress steps and error/info messages.
- Dockerized for easy deployment.

### Backend

- Express.js REST API for:
  - OTP generation and verification
  - PAN validation and submission
  - Registration data storage
- MongoDB integration (Atlas or Railway plugin recommended)
- Loads form schema from file (kept in sync with scraper)
- Dockerized for easy deployment
- Includes basic API tests (Jest + Supertest)

### Scraper

- `scrape_udyam.py` uses Selenium and BeautifulSoup to extract all form fields, labels, and options from the official Udyam registration page.
- Outputs a `form_schema.json` file used by both backend and frontend for dynamic form rendering.
